# 05 — Opening & Running Jupyter Notebooks
### Python Development | MCC BSIT 2526

[Back to Setup Overview](./Setup.md)

---

Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) are the main format for lectures and exercises in this course. You can open and run them in three ways — choose the one that works for your situation.

For theory-heavy topics, recordings and supplementary material are posted on **MS Teams**. The notebooks on GitHub are for code-focused lectures and exercises.

---

## Which Option Should I Use?

```
Do you have VS Code + Python installed on your laptop?
        |
        |-- YES --> Option A (recommended)
        |
        `-- NO
              |
              |-- Do you have a GitHub account?
              |        |
              |        |-- YES --> Option B — GitHub Codespaces
              |        |           (VS Code in your browser, no install)
              |        |
              |        `-- NO or Codespaces not working
              |                   |
              |                   `--> Option C — Google Colab
              |                        (just needs a Google account)
```

All three options open the same `.ipynb` file and run the same Python code. The difference is only where the code runs.

---

## Option A — VS Code (Local, Recommended)

Best experience. Code runs on your laptop. Push to GitHub directly.

### Opening a Notebook

1. Open VS Code
2. Open your repo folder: `File → Open Folder` → select your cloned repo
3. In the Explorer panel (left sidebar), click `M01_Exercises.ipynb`

### Selecting a Kernel

The kernel is the Python version that runs your code. Select it once per notebook.

1. Click **"Select Kernel"** in the top right corner of the notebook
2. Choose **"Python Environments"**
3. Select your installed Python version (e.g. `Python 3.12.x`)

> ⚠️ If no Python version appears, make sure Python is installed and VS Code has been restarted after installing the Python extension.

### Running Cells

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Run one cell | Click the play button on the left of the cell |
| Run one cell (keyboard) | Click inside the cell, press `Shift + Enter` |
| Run all cells | Click "Run All" in the toolbar |
| Stop a running cell | Click the stop button in the toolbar |
| Clear all output | Click "Clear All Outputs" in the toolbar |

### Submitting

Push directly from VS Code. See [06-Submit-Push.md](./06-Submit-Push.md).

---

## Option B — GitHub Codespaces (Online, No Install)

Full VS Code running in your browser, connected directly to your assignment repo. Works on any device including Chromebooks.

**Requirements:** A GitHub account (you already have one from GitHub Classroom)  
**Free limit:** 60 hours per month — sufficient for a full semester

### Opening Your Assignment in Codespaces

1. Go to your assignment repo on GitHub
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Click the **Codespaces** tab
4. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
5. Wait about 30 seconds — VS Code opens in your browser
6. Click `M01_Exercises.ipynb` in the Explorer panel
7. Select your kernel when prompted

Your work is auto-saved in the Codespace. You can close the browser and return later.

### Submitting from Codespaces

Open the terminal and run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed M01 exercises"
git push
```

Or use the Source Control panel in the left sidebar — same as local VS Code.

### Stopping a Codespace

Stop it when done to preserve your free hours:
1. Go to `github.com/codespaces`
2. Find your active Codespace
3. Click the `...` menu → Stop codespace

---

## Option C — Google Colab (Online, Any Device)

Works on any device with a browser and a Google account. No installation required.

**Requirements:** A Google account  
**Free limit:** None for basic use

> ⚠️ Colab disconnects after approximately 90 minutes of inactivity. Save your work often with `Ctrl + S`.

### Opening the Lecture Notebook

1. Go to the course repo on GitHub: `https://github.com/mcc-bsit-2526/Python-Development`
2. Navigate to the module folder
3. Click the **"Open in Colab"** button in the README
4. To save an editable copy: **File → Save a copy in Drive**

### Opening Your Assignment Notebook

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Click **File → Open notebook**
3. Click the **GitHub** tab and sign in to GitHub
4. Paste your repo URL and press Enter
5. Click `M01_Exercises.ipynb`
6. Click **"Copy to Drive"** at the top to save your own editable copy

### Running Cells in Colab

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Run a cell | Click the play button, or `Shift + Enter` |
| Run all cells | Runtime → Run all |
| Restart kernel | Runtime → Restart runtime |
| Clear outputs | Edit → Clear all outputs |

### Submitting from Colab

Colab cannot push to GitHub directly. Follow these steps:

1. Finish your work in Colab
2. File → Download → Download `.ipynb`
3. Go to your assignment repo on GitHub
4. Click **Add file → Upload files**
5. Upload your downloaded `.ipynb` file
6. Type a commit message, e.g. `Completed M01 exercises via Colab`
7. Click **Commit changes**

The autograder runs automatically after your commit.

## Understanding Cell Types

All three options use the same notebook format with two cell types:

**Markdown cells** — text cells with instructions and explanations. Read these carefully. You cannot run them.

**Code cells** — Python code you can edit and run. Output appears below the cell after running. These are where you write your answers.

---

## Your Workflow for Every Exercise

```
1. Read the Markdown cell (instructions)
2. Click the Code cell below it
3. Write your Python code
4. Press Shift + Enter to run
5. Check the output
6. Fix and re-run if needed
7. Move to the next exercise
```

---

## Adding Test Cells

You can add extra code cells anywhere to test your work — this does not affect your grade. The autograder only checks the specific functions in the exercise cells.

Hover between two cells and click **"+ Code"** to insert a new cell.

---

## Common Issues

**VS Code — "No kernel found"**  
Click "Select Kernel" (top right) → Python Environments → pick your Python version.

**Codespaces — takes too long to load**  
Wait up to 2 minutes on first creation. If it times out, refresh and try again.

**Codespaces — "You have no Codespaces"**  
Make sure you are signed into the same GitHub account used for Classroom.

**Colab — "Runtime disconnected"**  
Click Reconnect, then re-run all cells from the top since Colab clears memory on disconnect.

**Colab — cannot find the GitHub tab**  
Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) → File → Open notebook → GitHub → sign in when prompted.
